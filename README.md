In the world of operating systems and computer science, the efficient allocation of resources is a fundamental concern. Ensuring that processes can access the resources they require without conflicts is pivotal for system stability and safety. The Banker's algorithm stands as a well-established method to achieve this crucial goal, providing a framework for resource allocation while maintaining a safe state, thereby preventing resource contention and system failures.

	Objective

The primary objective of this project is to implement the Banker's algorithm in an interactive C++ program. This program aims to facilitate resource allocation, demonstrate system safety analysis, and interactively provide users with insights into the allocation sequence for a set of processes. By doing so, it enhances understanding of resource management and the principles of a safe operating system environment.

 Scope

This program offers a user-friendly interface for defining the total resources available in the system, allocating resources to processes, specifying maximum resource demands, and calculating resource needs. Subsequently, it employs the Banker's algorithm to assess whether the system is in a safe state, indicating whether processes can execute without resource conflicts. The scope of this project extends to educational applications, offering students and professionals hands-on experience in resource allocation and system safety analysis. It provides a valuable tool for learning and simulating real-world scenarios, fostering a deeper understanding of operating system principles and their practical implications.


This project aims to provide a foundation for understanding how the bankerâ€™s algorithm works and is put into practice.
